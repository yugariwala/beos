# 1. Introduction

## What is the Blood Emergency Platform?

The Blood Emergency Platform is a web-based application designed to streamline and accelerate the process of finding blood donors during medical emergencies. It connects hospitals, blood banks, and voluntary donors in real-time, ensuring that critical blood requirements are met as quickly as possible.

## Why This Platform is Needed

In medical emergencies, every second counts. Traditional methods of finding blood donors—phone calls, social media posts, or manual coordination—are time-consuming and unreliable. Hospitals often struggle to locate compatible donors, while willing donors may never know when their blood type is urgently needed nearby.

## Real-World Problem It Solves

- **Delayed Response**: Eliminates the delay between a hospital's blood requirement and donor notification
- **Lack of Coordination**: Provides a centralized system where all stakeholders (hospitals, blood banks, donors) can communicate instantly
- **Inventory Blindness**: Blood banks often lack visibility into their stock levels across locations
- **Donor Availability**: Donors don't know when or where their blood type is needed
- **Manual Tracking**: Replaces paper-based or disconnected systems with a unified digital platform

# 2. System Overview

## How the Platform Works Overall

The Blood Emergency Platform operates as a three-tier system:

1. **Frontend (User Interface)**: A responsive web application where users interact with the system—creating requests, managing profiles, viewing alerts, and tracking statuses.

2. **Backend (Server & Database)**: Processes all requests, manages user authentication, stores data securely, and handles business logic like donor matching.

3. **Real-Time Communication**: A live notification system that instantly pushes updates to connected users—ensuring donors see emergency alerts immediately without refreshing the page.

## How Frontend, Backend, and Real-Time System Interact

- When a hospital creates an emergency blood request, the frontend sends this to the backend server
- The backend validates the request, stores it in the database, and identifies potential matching donors
- The real-time system immediately broadcasts the emergency to all relevant donors
- Donors see the alert on their dashboard without any delay
- Status updates (fulfilled, cancelled) are pushed back to all connected users instantly

## What Happens During an Emergency Blood Request

1. Hospital staff logs into the platform
2. They create a new blood request specifying blood type, units needed, and urgency level
3. The system immediately notifies all eligible donors in the area
4. Donors can view the request details and respond
5. The hospital tracks responses in real-time
6. Once blood is arranged, the request is marked as fulfilled
7. All parties are notified of the successful completion

# 4. Core Features Explanation

## Authentication and Role-Based Access

- All users must create an account and log in to access the platform
- Each account is assigned a specific role (Donor, Hospital, Blood Bank, Admin)
- Different roles see different dashboards and features
- Sensitive actions require proper authentication
- Sessions remain active until the user logs out

## Donor Matching Logic

When a blood request is created, the system:
